House prices can vary depending on location and amenities offered. These facilities exist in a variety of shapes and designs, and their costs reflect these variations. While purchasers and rent owners want to decrease expenditures at a satisfactory level, architects and estate owners aim to provide homes with amenities that maximize their profit. The ability to estimate house prices may be used by both developers and buyers to calculate a home's selling price and purchase price given current facility availability.
As a result, this study aims to predict house prices using Pycaret Regression Analysis, which contrasted the outcomes of various regression techniques like Support vector regression, XGBoost, Decision tree regression, Random forest regression, and the like. Based on their performances, we chose the best among them for accurately forecasting the price of houses. The physical state of the home, the square footage of the rooms, the number of beds, waterfront, and the kind of floor were all factors that we focused on while training the models.
